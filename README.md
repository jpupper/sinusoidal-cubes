# Sinusoidal Cubes


Proyect in unity for making animations using sinusoidal formulas. 

I made a script that allows you to put in a prefab and then the script instanciates and animates several instances of this prefab using sinusoidal formulas. It translates,scale it and it assing it a color material to it.
